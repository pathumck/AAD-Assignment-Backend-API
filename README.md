Frontend Implementation :

The frontend for this project is a Single Page Application (SPA) POS System built using Bootstrap, jQuery, and AJAX.

Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework that makes responsive web design easier and faster.    
jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and AJAX interactions.
AJAX: A technique for creating asynchronous web applications, allowing the frontend to send and retrieve data from the server without refreshing the page.
